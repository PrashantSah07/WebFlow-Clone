                <div>Finding a good website layout idea could be the creative spark you need to transform your site’s
                    design to best represent your brand.</div>
                <div>Your website layout can be as functional as it is masterfully constructed, but it must serve the
                    greater purpose of selling your brand. Determining how to organize your site’s content can center
                    your brand’s mission and convince customers to convert.</div>
                <div>The importance of having a good layout</div>
                <div>After the internet’s inception,<span class="blue">web design reflected print media.</span> Columns
                    and rows followed rigid
                    lines, with content and images anchored to fixed spaces — similar to a newspaper magazine layout.
                    These uniform layouts limited the variation across websites. But as coding languages like <span
                        class="blue">HTML</span>, CSS,
                    and <span class="blue">JavaScript</span> evolved to improve loading times and site functionality, so
                    did new website layout
                    design possibilities, tools, and templates.<br><br>
                    Regardless of the <span class="blue">type of website</span>, how you present content is just as
                    important as the content
                    itself. If you have elements that distract users or make it difficult to read important information,
                    the user experience (UX) will suffer.<br><br>
                    Layouts should be catered to the type of content you’re presenting. For example, a landing page for
                    a sale should be organized in a way that makes it easy for visitors to learn about the products and
                    make a purchase. However, a blog layout should focus on making the article legible with minimal
                    distractions.<br><br>
                    Let these 10 layout ideas help you build a website that resonates with visitors and creates a
                    memorable experience.</div>
                <div>1. Add depth with a parallax<br>effect</div>
                <div>
                    <p style="display: inline;" class="blue">Parallax scrolling</p> adds depth to a layout design. The
                    website’s
                    background moves at a different pace than the foreground, creating a pseudo-3D effect. When done
                    subtly — without overwhelming visitors with too much movement — it layers graphics, images, and text
                    to make a page layout more dynamic and immerse visitors in the experience. People scrolling down
                    will be encouraged to continue to follow the parallax effect.
                </div>
                <div><img class="img-motion"
                        src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6009ec8cda7f305645c9d91b/640290379d88786659b23f61_XbWEhtlVsX39Hn3pX4t3xViEk8nHLowQZLJgwXCo6sm160gIq2CE8EAryEY0FEDVsHhbHPOi5IlLe1SIgD4lM13mkm8EsSFqQPcyBLHEd9dZl_fdH4N9QiiGpAv2xBdR6AJf_44lk55iSxlc2uuJ3ns.png"
                        alt="img2"></div>
                <div>
                    <p style="display: inline;" class="blue">Jack Jaeschke</p>, an Australian-based animator, motion
                    designer, and film editor, combines
                    illustration and video with parallax motion in his design portfolio. Colored, animated circles in
                    the background add color and play as visitors scroll through Jack’s site to learn about his work.
                    The dynamism of parallax offers Jack room to experiment with interactive design and showcase his
                    creativity without distracting from the content.
                </div>
                <div>2. Use overlapping elements</div>
                <div>With the freedom given by modern web design tools, website layouts can expand beyond the
                    self-contained columns of traditional layouts. Designers are free to <p style="display: inline;"
                        class="blue">stack the z-axis</p> with design elements — a shift from the organized columns of
                    print design with stacked elements — whether those elements are text, image, color, etc. Playing
                    with boundaries like this eliminates the rigid format to create unexpected but engaging layouts.
                </div>
                <div><img class="img-motion"
                        src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6009ec8cda7f305645c9d91b/640290952fe6751aa589fa58_f5mhKSSrYMBdKs5jBdSJuaRgnTpZgL4Yuki-pTyFlL7hRhvPlIKIRrW81CQa8ssxVPGl_Z6X6M5h_poXuF0VwgK5XtrwtgRZZyGaF1E7fz3m4PgCgBqHzVBvBo-plDkiGp9Atl6Djt_wXKdZZ-JYlF8.png"
                        alt="img3"></div>
                <div>
                    <p style="display: inline;" class="blue">Slay My Resume</p>’s site, designed by <p
                        style="display: inline;" class="blue">Stephen Voisey</p>, overlaps different colored boxes of
                    text to
                    guide visitors through the site’s message. The owner of Slay My Resume, Ali Williams, helps job
                    seekers refine their resumés and job applications to get hired. And Ali’s site keeps visitors
                    reading, just like a good resumé. The site’s images and squares of color slightly overlap,
                    transitioning the reader from section to section without interrupting the page. Visitors must
                    continue through the site to finish reading what’s in one section while already starting to read
                    what’s in the next.<br><br>

                    This style can help your brand communicate more information in less space when bullet points are all
                    the customer needs. For this site, the business proposition is clear in the section titled “5 Great
                    reasons why you should hire a resumé professional. Site visitors can learn the highlights of Slay My
                    Resume services while scrolling through a site with a pleasing, cohesive <p style="display: inline;"
                        class="blue">color palette</p> and <p style="display: inline;" class="blue">clear heading</p>
                    and reach out via a contact form at the bottom of the homepage
                </div>
                <div>3. Break up content with offset headers, subheaders, and columns</div>
                <div>With some layout designs, less is more. Too many complex <p style="display: inline;" class="blue">
                        animations</p> and other embellishments can
                    add clutter to a design. Often, offsetting elements and columns are all a layout needs to capture
                    enough attention to communicate a brand.

                    Like any non-traditional layout method, designers must balance the content and visuals. These
                    elements can be offset or overlapping, but they still need to be logically connected to guide
                    visitors.</div>
                <div><img class="img-motion"
                        src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6009ec8cda7f305645c9d91b/640291d1bec77389c44d2a07_lrCgxw0ypgC061WBsHKjmi_yrGgisZhbIo6DemG7XLjZ01_VQrCr2ojT39aPoLiRR1PBTnwrm_kHdzNOizsH-ad1Fla1TMBu61QFmG-bDfJMj7-e21hXkh8x0Hev7Fk6qrzERwE2m3V0iyUTDgNqPp0.png"
                        alt="img4"></div>
                <div>
                    <p style="display: inline;" class="blue">Alvogen</p>, a pharmaceutical company, uses this staggered
                    design approach, placing the text on the right with images on the left in some sections and swapping
                    the organization in other sections. This creates a visual ladder effect, moving site visitors down
                    the page.
                </div>
                <div>4. Lay out content with horizontal cards</div>
                <div>A horizontal layout is a simple way to keep a design from overcrowding. It also works well for
                    smartphone screens where the structure becomes a vertical scroll.</div>
                <div><img class="img-motion"
                        src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6009ec8cda7f305645c9d91b/60108219520a6b57513f0ea6_6002086f72b7272c1d01d8df_hypergiant-horizontal-cards.png"
                        alt="img5"></div>
                <div>
                    <p style="display: inline;" class="blue">Hypergiant</p>, a company offering advanced AI software
                    solutions for companies, uses horizontal cards for some of the most important content, creating a
                    timeline-like flow to its website. Instead of the standard, newspaper-like format of a heading, then
                    an image, then text, the horizontal display lets site visitors absorb each section in its entirety
                    before moving on, like a photo gallery or slideshow. People won’t need to scroll up or down to read
                    more information — the horizontal cards clearly present the site’s information in each snapshot.

                </div>
                <div>5. Split screens</div>
                <div>A split screen layout lets you break up big content blocks to maximize screen space. Dedicating
                    each side of the screen to complementary content delivers a more comprehensive experience.</div>
                <div><img class="img7"
                        src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6009ec8cda7f305645c9d91b/6010821ad5209b84a2e5823c_6002086f72b727b0bc01d8f4_ono-split-screen.gif"
                        alt="img7"></div>
                <div>Food kit company <p style="display: inline;" class="blue">Ono</p> uses split screens with
                    scroll-triggered animations for a UX full of color and movement. This creates a clear path to the
                    eventual call-to-action (CTA) at the bottom of both columns, as site visitors must continue
                    scrolling to read the text on the right side of the screen. As they scroll, new visuals emerge on
                    the left to add variation and prevent readers from growing bored.

                    Split screens are another practical way to link related blocks of content together. Instead of a
                    single web page with crowded content or requiring visitors to scroll, it neatly divides things into
                    two.</div>
                <div>6. Going big with giant copy</div>
                <div>Giant copy, when done right, commands attention to make a loud declaration about a brand or CTA.
                </div>
                <div><img class="img-motion"
                        src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6009ec8cda7f305645c9d91b/6010821ad5032e73c8ab5ffe_6002086f72b7273c5301df74_A7tx82pOKn2FtuRI_3OJ_JNRzlu17RMYlKF5YDwJkP5PV5SHRgpfp6riQiZvMlX9uaH0sJ96bXXBzcVE6gXLDlFgGiD9pJDzw8j4Nr8JZVFqg_DEK9_F7IUvkHeLP-9oSXIIKpal.png"
                        alt="img8"></div>
                <div>The giant headline and downward arrow on the homepage of digital agency <p style="display: inline;"
                        class="blue">Okalpha</p> immediately
                    encourages the user to scroll down to find out more. And the greeting — “Hey. We’re ok.” — acts as
                    both an introduction and conversation starter, as though you’ve already asked how they’re doing.
                    When site visitors scroll down to learn more about Okalpha, they’re met with a short description of
                    the brand and what they do.<br><br>
                    When using oversized type, make sure there's a clear intent behind the message, like a CTA. For this
                    site, it leads to the site’s “About” section, inviting visitors to learn more about the agency and
                    its work.</div>
                <div>7. Opt for a horizontal scroll</div>
                <div>Horizontal or side-scrolling impacts a website’s content organization and is often used instead of
                    a vertical scroll to show off brand images and ideas.</div>
                <div><img class="img-motion"
                        src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6009ec8cda7f305645c9d91b/640294b3bec7738dc6505d33_oGhJ22h6bNeYo2OS-a9Wgz4Jc7oX5v4XiknxCJDfL_1HeBmIZDKTz56O4jyZ4oSIB1H0TGf0k_9hgjfFBLMjZuYRcwgLp-x5oWGM9xZFSqnKjh_6U9ypMWHVN42MxRUq9WBGuZDF4HXe9s9ZO4720BE.png"

                <div>
                    <p style="display: inline;" class="blue">Alfredo Briccolo</p>’s design for <p
                        style="display: inline;" class="blue">Krasa Architecture, Light & Design</p> does this well by
                    using a side scroll to show off the firm’s portfolio.<br><br>
                    To organize an effective side scroll, text, images, and other elements must be consistent and
                    concise to fit the right messaging into screen size constraints. It creates the illusion of moving
                    through a gallery or flipping through a book, making side-scrolling a compelling and unique way to
                    navigate content. For Krasa Architecture, this layout allows visitors to sample past projects. Using
                    a grayscale image for each project entices visitors to move their cursor toward the image — and
                    hovering adds color to each image.

                <div>8. Inset sliders</div>
                <div>Inset sliders break from design protocol and give a web designer more creative freedom by saving
                    space. Traditionally, <p style="display: inline;" class="blue">carousels or sliders</p> break up a
                    design, which could negatively <p style="display: inline;" class="blue">impact
                        accessibility</p> and might move too quickly for visitors to absorb all content.<br><br>

                    But designers are refining sliders, making them less intrusive while retaining their functionality.
                    The goal is to create content that only takes a few clicks to explore so that people don’t have to
                    navigate to various pages.</div>

                    <p style="display: inline;" class="blue">Refokus Slider Generator</p> is a tool that can help you
                    create custom sliders with static elements or CMS collection lists without writing a single line of
                    code. This is especially helpful for ecommerce sites to showcase products without redirecting to a
                    new page.<br><br>

                    Save space on your site by adding visual content to a slider and letting people click through as
                    they need. Pair each image with alt text to ensure the content is accessible to more visitors, and
                    make sure the arrows are visible and intuitive so visitors can control the pace.

                <div>A CSS grid allows designers to control element positioning horizontally and vertically, giving them
                    more precise control over visuals and content. CSS grids are useful for experimentation, allowing
                    for broken grid website layouts and other unique designs. Use a <p style="display: inline;"

                <div>10.The continue rise of brutalism</div>
                <div>Responsive design, better-organized content, and refined navigation made cruising through the web a
                    more polished experience. Brutalism bucks all conventional design <p style="display: inline;"
                        class="blue">trends</p>, creating its own visual hierarchy.</div>

                <div>This <p style="display: inline;" class="blue">portfolio website</p> by designer <p

                    projects favors a <p style="display: inline;" class="blue">brutalist design</p> style.<br><br>

                    Brutalism pairs practicality with experimentation. As designers find new ways to innovate UX,
                    brutalists are innovating new ways to make noise with disruptive navigation, mixed focal points, odd
                    color schemes, asymmetrical layouts, grating visuals, and cryptic content. Joshua’s design uses
                    bold, black text on an off-white background, separated with horizontal lines, to declare the site’s
                    categories. Hovering over each phrase reveals a faded background image, and clicking leads to the
                    samples of work.<br><br>

                    This bold, jarring design is the perfect amount of unexpected that draws people in to learn more.
